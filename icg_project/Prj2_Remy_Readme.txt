Water surface - Rémy

We added the surface plane for the water, with a texture mix between blue and a "sea" texture. The water surface is animated with a similar code than with the homework 2. There is a composition of a stationnary and a progressive wave, which characteristic values (amplitude, frequency and wave vector) can be easily changed with variables.
The reflection of the water is pending, waiting for the skybox to be finalized.

Tesselation shader / LOD - Rémy

Added tessellation_cshader and tessellation_eshader.
In progress...
